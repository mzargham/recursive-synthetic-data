0,1,2,3,2, True,"""Both objects perform the function statistical regression by they do so according to different algorithms."""
1,1,2,3,3, False,"""These two regressions use different algorithms so they are not logically equivalent."""
2,1,12,13,2,True,"""Both objects perform the function of decision-making through different forms of aggregation."""
3,1,12,13,3,False,"""The objects use distinct algorithms and methods (trees vs. nodes) and are not logically equivalent."""
4,1,47,7,1,True,"""Both objects are conceptually related in the context of project management where the maintainer ensures smooth operation by making sense of experiences and data."""
5,1,47,7,2,False,"""The maintainer manages a project, which is functionally different from the process of giving meaning to experiences."""
6,1,47,7,3,False,"""The procedures carried out by a maintainer and those involved in sense-making are not logically equivalent."""
7,1,47,7,4,False,"""A maintainer and the process of sense-making are not physically the same and are not interchangeable."""
8,4,174,205,7,True,"""Both objects involve the movement of information within systems to support a process. Although 'feedforward' relates to forwarding information for process input, 'information retrieval' involves finding information to serve a purpose. They conceptually relate as both deal with the use of information."""
9,3,12,13,2,True,Both objects perform the function of decision-making through different forms of aggregation.
10,3,12,13,3,False,The objects use distinct algorithms and methods (trees vs. nodes) and are not logically equivalent.
11,0,3,126,1,True,"""Both objects involve optimizing processes: lasso regression optimizes model parameters with regularization, while feedback control systems optimize process performance through feedback mechanisms. They conceptually relate as both are methods aimed at improving system performance."""
12,0,3,126,2,False,"""A lasso regression is a specific algorithm in statistical modeling, while a feedback control system is a broader system concept. They perform different specific functions."""
13,0,3,126,3,False,"""The procedures and methods used in lasso regression and feedback control systems are distinct - one employs statistical regularization and the other involves control theory."""
14,0,3,126,4,False,"""A lasso regression is a mathematical technique, while a feedback control system is a physical implementation in control engineering. They are not physically interchangeable."""
15,0,155,168,1,True,"""Both 'authority' and 'management' are conceptually related, as both involve making decisions and coordinating resources."""
16,0,155,168,2,False,"""Authority involves the right to make decisions, whereas management involves the process of coordinating resources â€“ they serve different functions."""
17,0,155,168,3,False,"""The methods and procedures for exercising authority and management differ, indicating they are not logically equivalent."""
18,0,155,168,4,False,"""Authority and management are not physically the same and cannot be interchanged in a physical architecture."""
19,0,146,181,1,True,"""Participatory governance involves stakeholders in making decisions, which often necessitates terms or agreements akin to 'terms of service' that outline usage, creating a conceptual relation."""
20,1,146,181,2,False,"""Participatory governance and terms of service serve different functions: the former is a governance system including stakeholders, the latter is a legal agreement guiding usage."""
21,2,146,181,3,False,"""The methods and procedures in participatory governance versus terms of service are quite distinct, thus not logically equivalent."""
22,3,146,181,4,False,"""Physically, participatory governance is a governance system, while terms of service is a legal document, making them non-interchangeable in a physical architecture."""
